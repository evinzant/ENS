When a new transaction is submitted:
	1.	Verify Signature
	•	Confirm the author is known and the signature is valid
	2.	Check Model ID
	•	Make sure this model exists (or allow implicit creation)
	3.	Validate Weights
	•	Ensure weights are floats (or quantized ints), within acceptable range
	4.	Store Update
	•	Append to transaction log
	•	Update current in-memory model state
	5.	Broadcast Result
	•	Allow nodes to fetch updated model weights if needed
