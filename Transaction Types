1. weight_update
	•	When a model weight is updated (training or optimization)
	•	Includes model ID, layer, neuron index, old/new weights

2. model_commit
	•	Commits a new model architecture (optional)
	•	Includes model ID, structure hash, author, timestamp

3. output_commit (future)
	•	Swarm node reports encrypted output of a forward pass
	•	Used for zero-knowledge or traceability of inference
