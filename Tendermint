What Tendermint provides:
	•	Consensus (BFT): Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus across nodes
	•	Networking: Peer discovery, block propagation, transaction gossip
	•	Security: Signed transactions, public key identity
	•	Flexibility: You define what goes in the blocks — we control the logic

What is built on top:
	•	A custom ENS application that defines how:
	•	Model weight updates are structured
	•	Transactions are validated and accepted into the chain
	•	Nodes query the current model state
	•	The system syncs model state across the swarm
